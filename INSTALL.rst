This guide will show you how to run from source.

| A better option is dowloading the latest version
| for your OS from
| https://github.com/Pewpews/happypanda/releases

| If you have any questions, please find me here
| |Gitter| I'll try to answer as soon as possible.

First make sure you have python of minimum version 3.4 installed.

Download from here https://www.python.org/downloads/

-  arch: sudo pacman -S python3
-  ubuntu: apt-get install python3
-  OSX: see below

*Note: make sure to mark the 'Add to path' checkbox when available on
windows*

Linux
=====

#. Go where you want happypanda to be downloaded (E.g. ``cd ~``), and
   write ``git clone https://github.com/Pewpews/happypanda.git``

-  If it fails with something like 'unrecognized command 'git'' then do:
   ``sudo pacman -S git`` (``apt-get install git`` on Ubuntu), and try
   again

#. Install these dependencies:

-  Qt5 (Install this first) >= 5.4

   -  ``sudo pacman -S qt5-base`` (``apt-get install qt5-default`` on
      Ubuntu)

-  pip

   -  Python 3.4 should've included pip on install. Incase it didn't:
      ``sudo pacman -S python-pip``
   -  Enter the happypanda folder and write
      ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``

-  PyQt5

   -  I'm pretty sure you can install this through pip3, but if not then
      just ``sudo pacman -S python-pyqt5`` on Arch
   -  On Ubuntu

      -  ``apt-get install python3-pyqt5``
      -  ``apt-get install PyQt5``
      -  ``apt-get install python3-pyqt5``
      -  ``apt-get install python3-pyqt5.qtsql``

#. In the happypanda directory go to the *version* directory and write
   ``python3 main.py``
#. The program should now be running

Windows
=======

#. Go to the frontpage of the happypanda repo and click Download Zip
#. Extract to desired location
#. Install these dependencies:

-  Qt5 (Install this first) >= 5.4

   -  Download from https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2

-  pip

   -  Python 3.4 should've included pip on install. Incase it didn't
      https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html
      Make sure python is in your PATH.
      (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6318156/adding-python-path-on-windows-7)
   -  Now open cmd and ``cd`` to the happypanda folder
   -  Write: ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` and press enter

-  PyQt5

   -  I'm pretty sure you can install this through pip, but here is the
      download location
      http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5 (see
      Binary Packages for windows)

#. Finally, write ``python main.py`` to run the program
#. The program should now be running.

Note: Try renaming the 'main.py' file to 'main.pyw' and then just
doubleclick on it to try running without console (not guaranteed to
work)

Mac OS X
========

(Note: PyQt5 MUST be installed via Homebrew and NOT via Pip)

#. Install Homebrew (this makes everything easier)

-  Open Terminal
-  Run the following

   -  ``ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"``
   -  ``brew update && brew upgrade --all``

#. To install Python3, PyQt5, and sip (*still in Terminal*)

   -  ``brew install PyQt5``

#. To install other dependencies

   -  Download HappyPanda

      -  Go to github.com/Pewpews/happypanda
      -  Press the "Download ZIP" button
      -  UnZip happypanda-master.zip

-  In Terminal, navigate to the happypanda-master folder (E.g.:
   ``cd /where/ever/you/put/the/folder/happypanda-master``)

   -  Write ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``

#. Running HappyPanda

-  Run the following
-  ``cd /where/ever/you/put/the/folder/happypanda-master/version``

   -  (For example
      ``cd /Users/username/Downloads/happypanda-master/version``)

-  ``python3 main.py``
